## Multiple file uploads in Elm

This project owes a lot of inspiration to [this blog entry][UsingPortsInElm] I found via a [post on Stack Overflow][SO].

You can find a CRUD back end written in Go [here][rest-go] that handles the upload POST.

Finally, here is a good reference about the HTML5 [FileReader] object.
